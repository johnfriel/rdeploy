A simple script for 'deploying' static HTML sites to a webserver.
Current use is really nothing more than to save a few keystrokes 
typing arguments into rsync by saving the arguments in config files.
rdeploy expects to read server options from a file (in the directory
from which it's run) named '.rdeploy' and a list of files to ignore
from a file called 'rdeploy-ignore'. Enjoy!
